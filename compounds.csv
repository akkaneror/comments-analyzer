Why is there such a stigma around umbrella academy and Gerald way of this depressed energy or emo stuff. Yeah his stuff is dark but a lot of people worked on the umbrella academy tv show just cause the creator is a producer for the show doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an emo band tv show. Also it‚Äôs like your shaming or like attacking the show for being an honest show that isn‚Äôt afraid to show how dark the world really can be. Just like nirvana hated being called grunge mcr hates the label emo cause it‚Äôs an arbitrary branding that people use to try to understand what‚Äôs generally out of their depth.,-0.1871,0
